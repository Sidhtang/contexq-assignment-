## Overview

News Risk Intelligence System is an advanced tool for monitoring, analyzing, and identifying potential risks from news sources. The system collects articles from multiple news outlets, processes them using NLP to extract entities and sentiments, builds a knowledge graph of interconnected information, and identifies potential risk signals for organizations, individuals, and other entities.

This tool is particularly valuable for:
- **Know Your Customer (KYC)** processes
- **Anti-Money Laundering (AML)** monitoring
- **Supply Chain Risk Management**
- **Reputation Management**
- **Competitive Intelligence**

## Features

- **Multi-source News Collection**: Automatically collects articles from diverse news sources via RSS feeds
- **Advanced NLP Processing**: Uses Google's Gemini AI to extract entities, events, and sentiment from news content
- **Knowledge Graph Construction**: Creates a rich network of interconnected entities and their relationships
- **Risk Signal Detection**: Identifies potential risks based on sentiment analysis and network properties
- **Community Detection**: Groups related entities to surface hidden connections
- **Visualizations**: Generates network visualizations of risk signals for intuitive understanding
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Produces detailed risk reports with prioritized signals

## Architecture

The system is built with a modular architecture:

1. **NewsCollector**: Fetches and processes articles from RSS feeds
2. **NLPProcessor**: Analyzes article content using AI to extract structured information
3. **KnowledgeGraphBuilder**: Constructs a network representation of entities and their relationships
4. **RiskAnalyzer**: Identifies potential risk signals and generates reports


## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Google API key for Gemini AI

### Dependencies

```bash
pip install feedparser pandas numpy matplotlib beautifulsoup4 requests networkx google-generativeai
```

### Configuration

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/news-risk-intelligence.git
cd news-risk-intelligence
```

2. Set up your Google Gemini API key:
   - Replace the placeholder API key in the script with your actual key:
   ```python
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"  # Replace with your actual API key
   ```

3. Configure RSS sources (optional):
   - Edit the `rss_feeds` dictionary in the script to add or remove news sources

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the entire system with default settings:

```bash
python news_analysis_system.py
```

This will:
1. Collect recent news articles
2. Process them with NLP
3. Build a knowledge graph
4. Analyze for risk signals
5. Generate visualizations and reports

### Advanced Usage

You can also use the components individually:

```python
# Initialize components
collector = NewsCollector(rss_feeds, days_limit=14)
processor = NLPProcessor(model)
graph_builder = KnowledgeGraphBuilder()
risk_analyzer = RiskAnalyzer(graph)

# Collect articles
articles_df = collector.fetch_articles()
collector.save_articles("my_articles.csv")

# Process with NLP
processed_data = processor.process_articles(articles_df)
processor.save_processed_data("my_processed_data.json")

# Build knowledge graph
graph = graph_builder.build_graph(processed_data)
graph_builder.save_graph("my_knowledge_graph.graphml")

# Analyze risks
risk_signals = risk_analyzer.identify_risk_signals()
risk_report = risk_analyzer.generate_risk_report(top_n=10, filename="detailed_risk_report.json")
```

## Output Files

The system generates several output files:

- **collected_news_articles.csv**: Raw collected articles
- **processed_articles.json**: NLP-processed article data
- **news_knowledge_graph.graphml**: Knowledge graph in GraphML format
- **news_knowledge_graph.gexf**: Knowledge graph in GEXF format (for Gephi)
- **risk_analysis_report.json**: Detailed risk analysis report
- **risk_signal_X.png**: Visualizations of top risk signals

## Visualization

The system generates network visualizations for the top risk signals:


Nodes are color-coded as follows:
- **Red**: Negative sentiment articles
- **Green**: Positive sentiment articles
- **Gray**: Neutral sentiment articles
- **Blue**: Organizations
- **Orange**: Persons
- **Purple**: Locations
- **Cyan**: Products
- **Magenta**: Events

## Extending the System

### Adding New Data Sources

To add new RSS feeds:

```python
rss_feeds = {
    "Reuters Business": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/businessNews",
    "BBC World": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml",
    "Al Jazeera": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml",
    "Your New Source": "http://example.com/feed.rss"
}
```

### Customizing Risk Detection

You can modify the risk signal identification logic in the `identify_risk_signals` method of the `RiskAnalyzer` class:

```python
def identify_risk_signals(self):
    # Your custom risk detection logic here
    # ...
```

### Integration with Other Systems

The knowledge graph can be exported in standard formats (GraphML, GEXF) for integration with:
- Graph databases like Neo4j
- Visualization tools like Gephi
- Custom dashboards and reporting systems

## Cloud Deployment

This system is designed to be deployable to cloud platforms with the following architecture:

1. **Data Collection Layer**:
   - Serverless functions triggered on schedule
   - Queue system to manage article processing

2. **Processing Layer**:
   - Containerized NLP services
   - Auto-scaling based on queue depth

3. **Storage Layer**:
   - Document database for article data
   - Graph database for knowledge graph
   - Object storage for visualizations

4. **Analysis Layer**:
   - Batch processing for risk analysis
   - Real-time monitoring for new risks

5. **Presentation Layer**:
   - API endpoints for client integration
   - Dashboard for visual exploration

## Performance Considerations

- The NLP processing is the most resource-intensive part
- For large-scale deployment, consider:
  - Parallel processing of articles
  - Caching of API results
  - Incremental graph updates
  - Rate limiting for API calls

## Ethical Considerations

When using this system, please be aware of:

- **Data Privacy**: The system processes information about individuals and organizations
- **Bias in NLP**: Sentiment analysis may contain inherent biases
- **Source Reliability**: News sources have varying levels of accuracy
- **Contextual Understanding**: Risk signals should be verified by human analysts

## Limitations

Current limitations include:

- Limited to RSS feed content (no paywall access)
- English-language focused
- Limited historical data (14 days by default)
- API rate limits for the NLP service

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:

- **Multi-language Support**: Process news in multiple languages
- **Entity Resolution**: Better identification of the same entity across sources
- **Temporal Analysis**: Track how risk signals evolve over time
- **Advanced Risk Scoring**: More sophisticated risk calculation algorithms
- **Custom Alerting**: Personalized risk alerts for specific entities
