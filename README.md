## System Architecture

The system is composed of four main components:

1. **NewsCollector**: Fetches articles from RSS feeds and filters them by date.
2. **NLPProcessor**: Uses Google's Gemini model to extract entities, events, and sentiment from articles.
3. **KnowledgeGraphBuilder**: Constructs a graph representing relationships between entities and articles.
4. **RiskAnalyzer**: Identifies potential risk signals by analyzing the knowledge graph.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the entire system with default settings:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
1. Collect recent news articles
2. Process them with NLP
3. Build a knowledge graph
4. Analyze for risk signals
5. Generate visualizations and reports

### Advanced Usage

You can also use the components individually:

```python
# Initialize components
collector = NewsCollector(rss_feeds, days_limit=14)
processor = NLPProcessor(model)
graph_builder = KnowledgeGraphBuilder()
risk_analyzer = RiskAnalyzer(graph)

# Collect articles
articles_df = collector.fetch_articles()
collector.save_articles("my_articles.csv")

# Process with NLP
processed_data = processor.process_articles(articles_df)
processor.save_processed_data("my_processed_data.json")

# Build knowledge graph
graph = graph_builder.build_graph(processed_data)
graph_builder.save_graph("my_knowledge_graph.graphml")

# Analyze risks
risk_signals = risk_analyzer.identify_risk_signals()
risk_report = risk_analyzer.generate_risk_report(top_n=10, filename="detailed_risk_report.json")
```

## Output Files and Visualization

The system generates several output files:

- **collected_news_articles.csv**: Raw collected articles
- **processed_articles.json**: NLP-processed article data
- **news_knowledge_graph.graphml**: Knowledge graph in GraphML format
- **news_knowledge_graph.gexf**: Knowledge graph in GEXF format (for Gephi)
- **risk_analysis_report.json**: Detailed risk analysis report
- **risk_signal_X.png**: Visualizations of top risk signals

### Visualization
here are few  examples of the visualisations

example 2
![risk_signal_2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ae07ff1-d425-4560-813d-50f22c94ef71)



The system generates network visualizations for the top risk signals. Nodes are color-coded as follows:
- **Red**: Negative sentiment articles
- **Green**: Positive sentiment articles
- **Gray**: Neutral sentiment articles
- **Blue**: Organizations
- **Orange**: Persons
- **Purple**: Locations
- **Cyan**: Products
- **Magenta**: Events

## Design Choices

### NLP Models and Tools

- **Google Gemini 2.0 Flash**: Selected for its powerful entity extraction, event detection, and sentiment analysis capabilities. The model provides structured outputs in a JSON format that can be easily integrated into the knowledge graph.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Custom prompts were designed to extract specific types of information from news articles, including entities (organizations, persons, locations, products), events, and sentiment.

### Graph Schema

- **Nodes**:
  - Article nodes with attributes: title, source, date, link, sentiment
  - Entity nodes with attributes: name, type (Organization, Person, Location, Product, Event)
  
- **Relationships**:
  - Entity → Article: "mentioned_in"
  - Entity → Entity: "co_occurs_with" (weighted by frequency of co-occurrence)

### Analysis Techniques

- **Centrality Measures**: Degree and betweenness centrality are used to identify important entities in the network.
- **Community Detection**: The Louvain method is used to identify clusters of related entities.
- **Risk Signal Detection**:
  - High-visibility entities with negative sentiment
  - Entity clusters with a high proportion of negative sentiment articles
  - Impact score calculation based on negative sentiment ratio and number of connected articles

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Handling API Rate Limits

**Solution**: Implemented a caching mechanism to save processed articles and graph data to files, reducing the need for repeated API calls.

### Challenge 2: JSON Parsing from LLM Output

**Solution**: Added robust response parsing with fallback mechanisms to handle different formats returned by the model, including markdown code blocks and plain text.

### Challenge 3: Graph Visualization Complexity

**Solution**: Implemented subgraph extraction to focus on specific risk signals, making visualizations more interpretable. Color-coded nodes based on entity type and sentiment for better visual analysis.

### Challenge 4: Entity Disambiguation

**Solution**: Used entity types and simple normalization techniques (lowercase, remove spaces) to reduce duplicate entities. A more sophisticated solution would incorporate entity resolution algorithms.

## Cloud Deployment and Scalability

### Proposed Cloud Architecture

1. **Containerization**: Package the application using Docker for consistent deployment across environments.

2. **Microservices Architecture**:
   - News Collection Service: Scheduled job to fetch articles
   - NLP Processing Service: Scales based on article volume

3. **AWS Implementation**:
   - **Amazon ECS/EKS**: Container orchestration
   - **AWS Lambda**: For scheduled tasks and event-driven processing
   - **Amazon Neptune**: Graph database for storing and querying the knowledge graph
   - **Amazon S3**: Storage for article data and analysis results
   - **AWS API Gateway**: RESTful API endpoint

4. **Scalability Considerations**:
   - Horizontal scaling of NLP processing to handle variable article volumes
   - Batch processing for large volumes of articles
   - Caching of frequent queries and reports

5. **Deployment Layers**:
   - **Data Collection Layer**: Serverless functions triggered on schedule
   - **Processing Layer**: Containerized NLP services
   - **Storage Layer**: Document database for article data, Graph database for knowledge graph
   - **Analysis Layer**: Batch processing for risk analysis

## Extending the System

### Adding New Data Sources

To add new RSS feeds:

```python
rss_feeds = {
    "Reuters Business": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/businessNews",
    "BBC World": "http://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/world/rss.xml",
    "Al Jazeera": "https://www.aljazeera.com/xml/rss/all.xml",
    "Your New Source": "http://example.com/feed.rss"
}
```

### Customizing Risk Detection

You can modify the risk signal identification logic in the `identify_risk_signals` method of the `RiskAnalyzer` class:

```python
def identify_risk_signals(self):
    # Your custom risk detection logic here
    # ...
```

### Integration with Other Systems

The knowledge graph can be exported in standard formats (GraphML, GEXF) for integration with:
- Graph databases like Neo4j

3. **Processing Depth**: Current implementation uses only article titles and summaries, not full text.
4. **Language Bias**: System is currently optimized for English language content.
5. **Limited to RSS feed content**: No paywall access.
6. **Limited historical data**: 14 days by default.
7. **API rate limits** for the NLP service.

### Ethical Considerations

1. **Bias in Reporting**: News sources may have inherent biases that affect risk signals.
2. **False Positives**: System may flag innocent entities based on negative associations.
3. **Privacy Concerns**: Collecting and analyzing information about individuals raises privacy questions.
4. **Transparency**: Users should understand how risk scores are calculated and their limitations.
5. **Fairness**: System should be regularly audited to ensure it doesn't disproportionately impact certain groups.
6. **Source Reliability**: News sources have varying levels of accuracy.
7. **Contextual Understanding**: Risk signals should be verified by human analysts.

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Human-in-the-loop**: Final risk decisions should always include human judgment.
2. **Diverse Sources**: Include a wide range of news sources with different perspectives.
3. **Confidence Scores**: Provide confidence metrics for all risk signals.
4. **Regular Auditing**: Implement processes to identify and correct biases in the system.
5. **Documentation**: Clearly document system limitations for end users.
